**Self Assessment on Data Analytics Course**:

*What do I know. Competencies, skills, and knowledge where you are the most confident and proficient.*

My strongest foundation in data analytics lies in SQL and data preparation/integration using Tableau. I am highly proficient in writing complex SQL queries to extract, transform, and analyze data from relational databases. This skill enables me to clean and structure raw data efficiently, ensuring it’s ready for analysis. Using Tableau, I’ve built interactive dashboards and visualizations that help stakeholders uncover insights and make data-driven decisions. I’m confident in connecting Tableau to various data sources, blending datasets, and applying calculated fields to support dynamic reporting.
I also have solid experience in supervised and unsupervised data mining techniques, which I’ve applied to uncover patterns and predict outcomes from large datasets. I’m comfortable using classification, regression, clustering, and association rule mining to solve real-world problems. These techniques have helped me identify trends to build predictive models. My understanding of these methods is backed by practical applications in Python, where I used libraries like scikit-learn and pandas to build and evaluate models.
Additionally, I’m skilled in Python programming and working with Google Collab, which I use for exploratory data analysis and machine learning. I’m confident in retrieving data from APIs, parsing JSON responses, and integrating external data into my analysis workflows. This to work with third-party data sources, enriching my datasets and expanding the scope of my insights. My ability to combine Python with cloud-based tools like Collab makes my analytics work scalable, collaborative, and reproducible.

*What do I know. Competencies, skills, and knowledge where you are the least confident and proficient in.*

One area where I feel least confident is the use of RapidMiner, a tool I’ve had limited exposure to. While I understand its capabilities for performing data mining tasks through a visual workflow interface, I haven’t had much hands-on experience using it. As a result, I’m not yet comfortable navigating its environment and using its full potential for advanced analytics. I understand its value in simplicity and I’m actively seeking opportunities to improve my proficiency.
I also find Tableau a bit challenging in certain advanced use cases, especially when it comes to creating highly customized visualizations. While I’m confident in basic dashboard creation and data integration, I sometimes struggle with optimizing performance and implementing more complex calculations. I’m working on deepening my understanding of Tableau’s advanced features by working on personal projects
Another area I’m working on to improve is time series analysis and the use of Streamlit. Time series analysis requires a strong grasp of temporal patterns, forecasting techniques, and model evaluation, which I’m still developing. Similarly, while I’ve explored Streamlit for building simple data apps, I’m not yet proficient in creating fully interactive and production-ready applications. I see great potential in both areas for expanding my analytics toolkit and will work in building confidence through practice and learning.

*What do you wish you knew and/or don't realize you are missing*

After completing this program, I still feel that coverage of Large Language Models was missing. I had hoped for a deeper dive into both the theoretical foundations and the practical aspects of working with LLMs, but the assignments provided only limited exposure to that area. 

One prominent source of knowledge I used in data analytics was DataCamp and YouTube, especially for learning Tableau. I believe that continued hands-on practice with the software will deepen my understanding and improve my proficiency. 
In summary, I gained strong foundational skills in Python and had my first hands-on experience with Tableau and RapidMiner. I now look forward to further developing these skills and continuing to improve myself.
